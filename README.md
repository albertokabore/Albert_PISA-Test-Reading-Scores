Evaluating Factors Influencing PISA Test Reading Scores 

Problem Statement: 

The PISA (Program for International Student Assessment) dataset provides insight into the 
educational performance of 15-year-olds worldwide. This project aims to analyze various 
factors influencing students' reading scores. By evaluating demographics, parental 
education, school characteristics, and student behavior, we will identify significant predictors 
of reading performance. The findings can help educators and policymakers understand how 
to improve student outcomes. 
 
Dataset: PISA 
 
Dataset Overview: 

The dataset includes multiple features related to students' backgrounds and their 
performance in reading assessments. 

Project Steps: 

1. Data Loading and Preprocessing 

• Load the dataset and inspect the data for missing values and data types. 

Clean the data by handling missing values and converting categorical variables as 
needed. 

• Calculate and analyze descriptive statistics for key variables, such as reading scores 
and study habits. 

3. Data Visualization 

2. Descriptive Statistics 

• Create visualizations to explore relationships in the data, including box plots and 
scatter plots. 

4. Hypothesis Testing 

• Formulate hypotheses regarding the impact of specific factors (e.g., gender, parental 
education) on reading scores.

• Conduct appropriate statistical tests, such as t-tests or ANOVA, to evaluate these 
hypotheses. 

5. Regression Analysis 

• Use multiple regression analysis to identify significant predictors of reading scores. 

• Interpret the coefficients to understand the influence of each factor. 

6. Confidence Intervals 

• Calculate confidence intervals for the regression coefficients to assess the reliability 
of the estimates. 

7. Conclusion and Recommendations 

• Summarize the key findings from the analysis. 

• Discuss implications for educational practices and policies aimed at improving 

student performance. 
Deliverables: 

• A Python script or Jupyter Notebook containing the code for data analysis.

• A PPT report summarizing the findings, visualizations, and interpretations.
